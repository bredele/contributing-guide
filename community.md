# Community guidelines

  > This document is inspired by the github [community guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/) and vuejs [code of conduct](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)


Github is a place where millions of developers share their perspectives, ideas and experiences. It is a welcoming environment for all different voices and perspectives. It is important to encourage and maintain projects where people are free to express themselves.

## Better together

The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. It is a place where people work better together.

**Be welcoming and open-minded** - Other collaborators may not speak the same language, have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. Be welcoming to new collaborators on your projects and discussions, encourage people to work with you.

**Assume no malice** - Humans make mistakes, and disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life. Try to approach conflict from the perspective that people generally mean well. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions.

**Stay on topic** - People use GitHub to get work done and to be more productive. Off topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.

**Be clear** - Communicating with strangers on the Internet can be awkward. It's hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person.


## Code of conduct

By reading the following document, we pledge to respect all people who contribute regardless of their experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.

### What if something or someone offends you?

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to communicate expectations and moderate their projects by using the following tools:

**Moderate Comments** - Edit or delete anyone's comments on commits, pull requests, and issues if not aligned with this guideline.

**Lock Conversations**â€Š- If a discussion in an issue or pull request gets out of control, the project maintainers can lock the conversation.

**Block Users** - If a user continues to demonstrate poor behavior, the project maintainers can block the user from their personal account or organization.

Abusive behavior or content that do not respect Github [terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#legal-notices) might be investigated.

### What is not allowed?

**Threats of violence** - You may not threaten violence towards others or use the site to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others. Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that way. If you think that someone else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism, stop. Don't post it on GitHub. In extraordinary cases, we may report threats of violence to law enforcement if we think there may be a genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to public safety.

**Hate speech and discrimination** - While it is certainly not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or group of people on the basis of who they are. Just realize that talking about these or other sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even unsafe, if approached in an aggressive or insulting manner. We expect our community members to be respectful when discussing sensitive topics.

**Bullying and harassment** - We do not tolerate bullying or harassment. This means any habitual badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of people. In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory.

**Impersonation** - You may not impersonate another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, using a similar username or otherwise posing as someone else. Impersonation is a form of harassment.

**Doxxing and invasion of privacy** - Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, or passwords. This is also a form of harassment as it may present safety risks or other harms.

**Active malware or exploits** - Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other members of the community. We do not allow anyone to use our platform for exploit delivery, such as hosting malicious executables, or as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers. Note, however, that we do not prohibit the posting of source code which could be used to develop malware or exploits, as the publication and distribution of such source code has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community.
