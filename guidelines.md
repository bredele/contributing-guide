  - It is recommended to fork the project and create a test case for your issue if the project has unit tests.


## Pull Request Guidelines

  > inspired by [Github PR guidelines](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request)

We consider pull request as the primary process to communicate, explore and share ideas and features. Pull Request should be created at the beginning of this process and not at the end.

### Approach to writing a Pull Request

  - Include a brief sentence to explain the purpose of this Pull Request. For example:
    * This is a spike to explore‚Ä¶
    * This simplifies the display of‚Ä¶
    * This fixes handling of‚Ä¶

  - Consider providing an overview of why the work is taking place (with any relevant links); don‚Äôt assume familiarity with the history.

  - Remember that anyone could be reading this Pull Request, so the content and tone may inform people other than those taking part, now or later.

  - Use clear language and be explicit about your expectations.

  - @mention individuals or teams that you specifically want to involve in the discussion, and mention why.

Pull Request are a safe place, there are no wrong questions and any feedback are welcomed.

### Offering feedback

Feedback and criticism should always be positive and draw attention to a good or positive aspect of something which is being ignored, disregarded or overlooked. If you disagree with something, please consider giving it a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the issue and before responding. We won't accept language that do not respect our [community guideline](/community.md).

  - Ask, don't tell and most important, explain your reasons why you disagree and why code should be changed. Communication is about trying to understand other's people perspective and background.

  - Avoid using derogatory terms, like ‚Äústupid‚Äù, when referring to the work someone has produced.

  - Be humble. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, let‚Äôs try‚Ä¶‚Äù)

  - Avoid hyperbole. (‚ÄúNEVER do‚Ä¶‚Äù)

  - Be aware of negative bias with online communication. (If content is neutral, we assume the tone is negative.) Can you use positive language as opposed to neutral?

  - Use emoji to clarify tone. Compare ‚Äú‚ú® ‚ú® Looks good üëç ‚ú® ‚ú®‚Äù to ‚ÄúLooks good.‚Äù
